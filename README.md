# Career Progression App - Backend

This is the Django REST Framework API for the Progression application.

## Prerequisites

- **Git:** To clone the repository.
- **Docker Desktop:** To run the application environment using Docker Compose. ([https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- **Python:** (Optional, for local commands) Version 3.13+ recommended.
- **pip:** Comes with Python.

## Getting Started (Docker Compose - Recommended)

This is the easiest way to run the full application stack (Frontend, Backend, Database).

1.  **Create Workspace Folder:** Make a main directory for the project on your computer.
    ```bash
    mkdir project-workspace
    cd project-workspace
    ```
2.  **Clone Repositories:** Clone both the frontend and backend repositories **inside** the workspace folder. Make sure they are named `frontend` and `backend`.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amarnuhovicbt/career-progression-web.git frontend
    git clone https://github.com/amarnuhovicbt/career-progression-api.git backend
    ```
3.  **Add `docker-compose.yml`:** Get the `docker-compose.yml` file (see content below) and place it directly inside your `project-workspace` folder.
4.  **Run Docker Compose:** Navigate **back up** to the `project-workspace` directory (the one containing `docker-compose.yml`). Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    - The `--build` flag is needed the first time or if Dockerfiles change.
    - This will build images and start containers for the frontend, backend, and database.
5.  **Access Application:** The backend is typically accessed via the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

### ðŸ—‚ Project Directory Layout

    project-workspace/
    â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/            <-- Cloned frontend repo (git clone ... frontend)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ backend/                 <-- Cloned backend repo (git clone ... backend)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml   <-- The file that runs everything

## Available Scripts (Local)

- `cd backend`
- `python -m venv venv`
- `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` - if not already
- `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

## Docker Compose File (`docker-compose.yml`)

This file should be placed in the parent `project-workspace` directory.

```yaml

    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/

# Code Formatting with `black`

To ensure consistent code style, we use the `black` code formatter. This project already has `black` configured. This guide explains how to use the existing setup and how it works.

## Black Installation Status

`black` is already included in the `requirements.txt` file for the project. When you set up the project environment, you should have installed it along with other dependencies.

1. **If You Need to Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   Navigate to the `backend` directory and activate your virtual environment.

2. **If You Need to Reinstall Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Using the Configured Black Formatter

Black is already configured for this project. Here's how to use it:

### Format All Files:

To format all Python files in your project, simply run the following command in the root of the backend directory:

```bash
black .
```

This will recursively format all Python files in the directory and its subdirectories.

### Format a Specific File:

If you only want to format a specific file (e.g., urls.py), you can specify the path to that file:

```bash
black ./accounts/urls.py
```

## Current Black Configuration

Black is already configured through the project's pyproject.toml file. Black uses these settings automatically when formatting your code.

## VSCode Integration

For the best development experience, it would be a good idea to install the Black formatter extension in VSCode.

### Install the Black Formatter Extension:

1. Open VSCode
2. Go to the Extensions tab (or press Ctrl + Shift + X)
3. Search for "Black Formatter" and install the extension provided by ms-python

### Configure VSCode User Settings:

To enable automatic formatting on save, you'll need to update your VSCode user settings:

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P)
2. Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)" and select it
3. In the settings file, add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter"
  }
}
```

This configuration does two things:

- It enables format on save, so your Python files will be automatically formatted when you save them
- It sets Black Formatter as the default Python formatter
